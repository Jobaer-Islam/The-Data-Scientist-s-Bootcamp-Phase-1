# 120-Day Job Landing Challenge

## Overview
This repository documents my 120-day (4-month) **Job Landing Challenge**, designed to build strong fundamentals, practical coding skills, and professional development habits required to secure a role in Python development and related fields.

The challenge is mentor-guided, time-bound, and publicly documented to ensure accountability and measurable progress. It emphasizes a strict, no-excuse approach, treating participants as professionals from day one.

## Objectives
- Build strong foundations in Python programming (basic to advanced)
- Develop hands-on experience through daily coding tasks, quizzes, and projects
- Strengthen problem-solving and implementation skills
- Gain exposure to industry-relevant tools and frameworks (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.)
- Build professional habits: documentation, logging, consistency
- Prepare for job applications with CVs, GitHub profiles, and portfolio projects
- Create a transparent learning trail for review and feedback
